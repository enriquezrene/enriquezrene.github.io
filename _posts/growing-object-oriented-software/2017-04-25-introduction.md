From now on, I'm gonna write a series of posts that summarizes the main ideas from the book:

> Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by Tests 
> By Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.

This is an awesome book recommended by rock stars in Software Development like [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/), [Yegor Bugayenko](http://www.yegor256.com/) among others.

I'm pretty sure you will enjoy the journey as much as I did. If you have any questions about my summaries, feel free to send me an email and we can discuss anything more in deep.
