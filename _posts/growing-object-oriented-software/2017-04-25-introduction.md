From now on, I'm gonna write a series of posts that summarizes the main ideas from the book:

> Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by Tests 
> By Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.

This is an awesome book recommended by rock stars in Software Development like [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/), [Yegor Bugayenko](http://www.yegor256.com/) among others.

If you want to buy this book, please use this link:
