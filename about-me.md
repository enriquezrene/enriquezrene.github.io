I'm Rene Enriquez (Quito, Ecuador) a software developer passionate by cutting edge technologies. 

As a programmer, I write mostly in Java, but also using Scala, Groovy and JavaScript. 
Currently I'm really glad using IntelliJ but it would change, the history of IDEs in my career has been:

Netbeans -> Eclipse -> JBoss Developer Studio -> STS -> IntelliJ  

I'm an Oracle Certified Professional, OCJP. I also wrote a book about the foundation for securing restful web services. If you're interested on it, here is the link:
